Machine Learning a Linear Function using Gradient Descent

This repository is a small java program which finds the best fit line. This is the most basic form of supervised machine learning, where the machine attemps to learn M and B from the linear equation: y = Mx + B

For example, with the following input or training data:

It will find the constants M = 1.2, B = 4.7

Which corresponds to the dotted line below.

This example input data comes from the Coursera course on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng.

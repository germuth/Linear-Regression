Linear-Regression
Machine Learning a Linear Function using Gradient Descent and the Normal Equation

This repository is a small java program which learns the best fit line of a series of data points. This is the most basic form of supervised machine learning.

For example, trying to learn the two variables of a line, M and B from the linear equation: y = Mx + B

With the following input or training data:

It will find the constants M = 1.2, B = 4.7

Which corresponds to the dotted line below.

This example input data comes from the Coursera course on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng.
